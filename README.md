# Welcome to **POPA**! 

![POPA](assets/popa_display.png?raw=true "Popa")

We had a blast during this DSC Retro Hackathon, thank you for the opportunity!

# Inspiration
We were inspired by our favourite retro games such as Tetris, Breakout, Pacman. 
We took the best parts of each game, like combos and blocks from Tetris, the scoring 
systems from Breakout, and the music inspiration from all three.

We believe that art and music play a big part in a good game. We made it a high priority
to create retro art and music that matched our overall theme.

# Requirements
Popa runs on Google Chrome, preferably. Other web browsers may work but all testing was done
on Chrome, so we recommend it. 
Aside: Also refresh the page a couple times - because sometimes the font doesn't load immediately. 
(You've got to play with Orbitron otherwise you can't say you've played the game) :)

# Tech Stack
We used Javascript in combination with a 2D game library Phaser 3 (it was our first time!)
Game sprites designed in Piskel 
Background music designed in Reaper/Cakewalk

# Credit
Background music designed and produced by us.
All art designed and created by us (apart from background).

# Last Words
Please Enjoy The Game and best of luck to the other competitors!
