Welcome to **POPA**!

We had a blast during this DSC Hackathon, and could not thank you enough for 
this opportunity!

# Inspiration
We were inspired by our favourite games, Tetris, Breakout, Pacman. We took the
best parts of each game and attempted to weave it into our game. (I.e the music,
the graphics, the mechanics).

We believe that art and music play a big part in a good game. We tried to go 
for retro art and retro music that matched our theme.

# Requirements
To be able to run this game you just need a working browser with a Javascript engine.
Sometimes the font doesn't load properly so a refresh might be needed.

# Credit
All Music and Art owned and produce by us.

# Tech Stack
We used JAVASCRIPT. Namely a very good library called Phaser. We researched and 
used Phaser for the first time today. It was very good with
a expansive API and a vast amount of useful functions. 

We used Piskel to generate our sprites. And Reaper/Cakewalk for music.

# Last Words
Please Enjoy The Game.
