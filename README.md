Welcome to **POPA**! 

![](assets/POPA PIC.png?raw=true "Title")

We had a blast during this DSC Hackathon, and could not thank you enough for 
this opportunity!

# Inspiration
We were inspired by our favourite games, Tetris, Breakout, Pacman. We took the
best parts of each game and attempted to weave it into our game. (I.e the music,
the graphics, the mechanics).

We believe that art and music play a big part in a good game. We tried to go 
for retro art and retro music that matched our theme.

# Requirements
To be able to run this game you need GOOGLE CHROME. I think haven't tried with 
others. Also refresh the page a couple times - because sometimes the font doesn't
load. (You've got to play with Orbitron otherwise you can't say you've played the game.

# Credit
Music produced by US.
Art owned by US.
When I say US, I mean us not (United States). 

The background however, was taken from a free background website. "You can
immediately use for your project with ease!" they said. SO we did.

# Tech Stack
We used JAVASCRIPT. Namely a very good library called Phaser. We researched and 
used Phaser for the first time today. (18th October 2020). It was very good with
very clear API and a vast amount of useful functions. 

We used Piskel to generate our sprites. And Reaper/Cakewalk for music.

# Last Words
Please Enjoy The Game.
